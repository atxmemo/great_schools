    <comments>I have hasd 2 children at Alameda High and I find the school to be 'okay. As a large public high school, with a huge variation of academic abilities, it is extremely important for parents to stay in touch with course choices and expectations of teachers to ensure their child's basic education. Their music and drama programs are excellent - don't know about sports. Easy to lose your way in such a large environment - stay in touch with counselors and teachers.</comments>
